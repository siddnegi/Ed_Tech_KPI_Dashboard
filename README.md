# Ed-Tech LMS Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This dashboard was created to replicate my experience working at an ed-tech company as an individually contributing product manager, where monitoring student engagement and product performance was crucial for business success. The project simulates a Learning Management System (LMS) analytics platform that tracks various key performance indicators (KPIs) across different product features.

## Business Context
In the ed-tech space, understanding how students interact with various learning features is vital for:
- Optimizing the learning experience
- Reducing student drop-off
- Improving feature adoption
- Making data-driven product decisions
- Enhancing student engagement and satisfaction

## Project Components

### 1. Data Generation (lms-data-generator.py)
- Created synthetic LMS interaction data for 1000 users across 20 batches
- Generated realistic metrics for 15 different product features
- Simulated one month of user interaction data
- Included various engagement metrics like duration, conversion, and NPS

### 2. Interactive Dashboard (lms_dashboard.py)
- Built a real-time analytics dashboard
- Implemented feature-wise KPI tracking
- Created interactive visualizations for trend analysis
- Designed an intuitive user interface for easy navigation

## Key Metrics Tracked

1. **Average & Median Duration**
   - Helps understand time spent on each feature
   - Identifies which features are most engaging
   - Guides content length optimization

2. **Conversion Rate**
   - Measures successful feature completion
   - Indicates feature effectiveness
   - Helps identify successful user journeys

3. **Drop-off Rate**
   - Highlights where users struggle
   - Identifies features needing improvement
   - Guides retention strategy

4. **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**
   - Measures user satisfaction
   - Indicates feature quality
   - Helps prioritize improvements

## Business Impact & Decision Making

### Product Development
- Identify which features need improvement
- Prioritize feature development based on usage patterns
- Optimize user experience based on engagement metrics

### Student Success
- Track learning effectiveness
- Identify struggling students early
- Improve completion rates

### Business Growth
- Reduce churn through early intervention
- Improve feature adoption rates
- Enhance overall platform effectiveness

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages
- Python 3.x

### Libraries
- Streamlit: For building the interactive web application
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- Plotly: For interactive data visualization
- NumPy: For numerical computations

### Features
- Real-time data processing
- Interactive visualizations
- Feature-wise analytics
- Responsive design
- Custom styling
